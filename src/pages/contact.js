                 Applications are sought for a Postdoctoral Research Scientist (5 year fixed term) and a Research Assistant (2 year fixed term with possible extension) in our group, for a Cancer Research UK funded research project to study the role of RNA binding proteins in Myeloid Leukaemia.
                 Our lab studies the role of RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs) in the survival of leukaemic stem cells in acute myeloid leukaemia, with the goal of determining druggable targets to improve leukaemia treatment. This exciting project aims (1) to interrogate the hypothesis whether altered post-transcriptional regulation by RBPs leads to the development and maintenance of leukaemia, (2) to determine if they have a differential role in normal haematopoiesis, and (3) to understand the molecular mechanism(s) underlying RBPs function in blood cancer. The project will employ in vitro and in vivo hematopoietic assays, transcriptome-wide RBPsâ€™ target identification, proteomics, imaging, molecular biology and bioinformatic analyses, using human and mouse cell cultures as well as genetic knockout/knockin models.
                </p>

                <p>
                 You will be a key member of the group and enjoy a vibrant multidisciplinary environment at BCI, and will be supported to develop their scientific career and have an impact in the RNA and cancer field.

                <p>
                Essential requirements for these posts include a PhD (for Postdoc candidates) and a BSc/MSc (for RA candidates) in a relevant biological subject and an undergraduate degree in a medical/biological subject. Significant research laboratory experience in Hematology, Cancer biology, RNA biology, as well as Cell & Molecular biology is essential. Additional experience in mouse genetic models and next-generation sequencing would be an advantage. A demonstrable ability of good scientific communication, working within a scientific team, and maintaining good laboratory records is also essential.
